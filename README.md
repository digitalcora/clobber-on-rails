Clobber on Rails
================

Clobber on Rails is a browser-based version of [Clobber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber) with head-to-head online play, written in Rails for [Dan Bogaard's](http://people.rit.edu/dsbics/) Web Client/Server Programming class at [RIT](http://www.rit.edu/). See the [project page](http://grantovich.net/projects/clobber-on-rails/) on my personal web site.

A live instance of this app was previously hosted on Heroku, which may still be referenced in the code. That site has since been taken down, and I do not maintain this project.
