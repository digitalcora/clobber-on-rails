Clobber on Rails
================

Clobber on Rails is an online browser-based implementation of [Clobber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber), a simple two-player board game. This project is being done for [Dan Bogaard's](http://people.rit.edu/dsbics/) Web Client/Server Programming class at [RIT](http://www.rit.edu/), and is powered by [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (hence the name).
