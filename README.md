Clobber on Rails
================

Clobber on Rails is an online browser-based version of [Clobber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber) (a simple two-player board game), written in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for [Dan Bogaard's](http://people.rit.edu/dsbics/) Web Client/Server Programming class at [RIT](http://www.rit.edu/). See the [project page](http://grantovich.net/projects/clobber-on-rails/) on my personal web site.

This code is currently live at [http://clobber-on-rails.heroku.com](http://clobber-on-rails.heroku.com), though I make no guarantees that it will remain there for any length of time.
