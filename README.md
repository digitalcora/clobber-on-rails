Clobber on Rails
================

Clobber on Rails is an online browser-based version of [Clobber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber), a simple two-player board game. This project was created for [Dan Bogaard's](http://people.rit.edu/dsbics/) Web Client/Server Programming class at [RIT](http://www.rit.edu/): Certain odd design decisions you might notice (such as the game board being entirely SVG) are a direct consequence of the project requirements.

As the name suggests, this app is written in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). It's also live at [clobber-on-rails.heroku.com](http://clobber-on-rails.heroku.com), should you wish to try it out.
