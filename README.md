# Clobber on Rails

This app is a browser-based version of [Clobber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber) with head-to-head online play, written for [Dan Bogaard's](http://people.rit.edu/dsbics/) Web Client/Server Programming class at RIT. It features a basic user account system with win/loss tracking, pre-game and in-game chat, and an SVG game board (using SVG was a project requirement).

**Note:** Clobber on Rails was my first Rails app ever. It has no tests, very little documentation, more than a few rough edges, and is mostly interesting as a historical curiosity. I do not maintain this project, and the live Heroku deployment referenced in the code no longer exists.
